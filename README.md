# Android-Todo-List-App-with-MVVM-and-Architecture-Components

This is an Android application written in Kotlin to practice one of the architecture models in mobile world which is **MVVM (Model View ViewModel)**.

Components used in the application:
- AndroidViewModel
- LiveData
- Room
- Kotlin
- AndroidX
- Navigation Component(incomplete)

Things which will be added in future:
-more functions
- More appealing UI
- Dagger for dependency injection

The app lets the user create, edit, delete and complete todo items. When the set due date comes, app notifies the user stating the **An item in your list is due.**
UI is not that appealing as the most focused part of the app is architecture and components behind it.
